# Chatbot Project - Powered by Gemini AI

This project is a simple React-based chatbot that integrates with the Gemini AI API to respond to user input. It utilizes state management and form handling to facilitate an interactive and user-friendly conversation. This project uses **Tailwind CSS** to achieve a responsive and professional design.

## Project Overview

This chatbot uses the **Gemini AI** to provide dynamic responses based on user queries. Built with React, it manages conversation history and displays responses from both the user and the bot. The bot responses are fetched asynchronously from an API, ensuring seamless user interactions.

The app follows a simple flow:

1. User submits a message.
2. The message is sent to the Gemini AI API.
3. The bot replies based on the AI's response.
4. The conversation continues as the user interacts with the bot.
